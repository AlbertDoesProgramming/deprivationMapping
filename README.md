Taking work home with me...

## What is this project?

At work I'm currently working on some interesting data visualisation pieces and some of the tasks have taken me back to some work I did during my masters thesis..

My masters thesis looked at a couple of VERY interesting things, under the rough bracket of mental illness and neighbourhood level deprivation. It turns out, this topic is pretty complicated, and I didn't really feel like I got the chance to do it justice during my MSc. There's just so much there!

So I thought I'd use some of the skills I've developed since working as an analyst to bring a bit more life to a pretty dry topic. This repo is going to store a data science project, that will output one or perhaps a series of visualisations, allowing a user to explore some of the more interesting facets of neighbourhood level deprivation, and the effects it can have on a variety of social and personal issues, maybe including mental health if I can find something suitably anonymised.

### Goals

Where is this project going? Right now I'm not entirely sure. I just want to practice some visualisation and data science techniques with a dataset that I'm relatively familiar with.

Some medium term outcomes I'd like to come from this:

1. A web accessible Choropleth that visualises deprivation.
1. A simple user interface that allows searching for ones area by postcode
1. Use machine learning to predict mental health outcomes by area
